Web Infrastructure Design:
Server (8.8.8.8):

This is a physical or virtual machine that hosts our entire web infrastructure.
Domain Name: www.foobar.com

The domain name is a human-readable address that users can use to access the website.
The domain name www.foobar.com is configured with a DNS A record that points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx acts as the web server, responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
It listens for requests on port 80 (default HTTP port).
Application Server:

The application server is responsible for running the application code. In this case, it might be using a technology like FastCGI or a WSGI server to communicate with the web server.
It communicates with the web server through a specified port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:5000).
Application Files (Code Base):

The application files contain the code that defines the website's functionality.
These files are hosted on the server and are accessed by the application server when handling user requests.
Database (MySQL):

MySQL is used as the database management system to store and manage the website's data.
The application server communicates with the database server (MySQL) to perform read and write operations.
Specifics:
Server:

A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
Domain Name:

The domain name is a human-readable address that translates to an IP address. It provides a user-friendly way to access websites.
DNS Record for www:

The DNS record for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing to the root domain or an A record.
Web Server:

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests, serving static content, and forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server.
Application Server:

The application server executes the application code, processes dynamic content requests, and communicates with the database.
Database:

The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, allowing the application to retrieve and update information.
Communication with User's Computer:

The communication between the user's computer and the server is facilitated through the HTTP protocol over the internet.
Issues:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

This infrastructure has a single server, making it vulnerable to a single point of failure. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime during Maintenance:

Deploying new code or performing maintenance tasks may require restarting the web server, resulting in downtime during these activities.
Limited Scalability:

With only one server, it's challenging to handle a large volume of incoming traffic. Scalability is limited, and the website may become slow or unresponsive during traffic spikes.
